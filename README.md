# phonebook app using node js

This project is the backend of phonebook app created using node js. In this project, one can handle get,put,post and delete requests. I am currently doing a MERN bootcamp in which i had learned the backend development using node js,mongoose and express. I dont know much about frontend development using React as I am still learning. I had tested all the routes using postman.
